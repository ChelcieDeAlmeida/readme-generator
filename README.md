 # **_README-GENERATOR_**
  
## **_Description_**
This application removes the tediousnes of having to create README files for every project using a command line prompted questionnaire to generate a template that users can customize however they so choose. 

## **_Technologies Used_**  
* JavaScript
* NodeJS (Inquirer)

## **_Installation_**
Note: users are expected to know some JavaScript

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you haven't done so yet.
* You should also have pulled this repository at this point (we'll get to Node in second)
* The bulk of this project focuses on the 'generateMarkdown' file in the 'Util' folder and the Index.js file on the root of this repo's directory. You can ignorethe package* files.
* On your project directory, you will initialize npm by typing ```npm init```
* After that command runs a series of processes, you're ready to use npm.
* Type ```npm install inquirer``` on the root of the repo you've just pulled. This will fetch inquirer making it possible for Node to use the functionality provided by the inquirer package. 
* At this point, the project is ready. Let's now run ```node index.js``` on your terminal (make sure you're on the same directory as the 'index.js' file when you run the command)
* You should be getting prompted to answer questions on your command line. Go through them and a README.md file will be generated as shown in the following video:
